# Green-Gardening
Green Gardening involves growing plants using organic fertilizers and pesticides so that the gardening process or the flowers and fruits produced thereby doesn't adversely affect the environment or people's health in any manner.​
The growing concern about where our food comes from is increasing the number of people who want to grow their own vegetables, fruits, berries, or herbs that would fit on the smallest balcony or terrace wherever they live.​
There are several ways to develop small-space gardening ideas into business, encouraging others to eat sustainable food by helping them grow their own.​
